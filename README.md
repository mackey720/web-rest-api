# web-rest-api

Backend Engineer Coding Challenge

This is a Maven Project. It included a little more than what was callec in the requirements. 
I interpreted the requirements differently at first, hence the extra api endpoint.

The project includes some Spring dependencies i.e.
- Spring Web
- Spring Boot Dev Tools
- Spring Data JPA
- H2 Database

Eclipse IDE was used to develop the code and test. PostMan Google chrome extension was used to test the apis (api/supervisors, api/submit and api/managers)

The code can be imported as an existingg Maven project and can be executed by running the ManagersApplication class.
